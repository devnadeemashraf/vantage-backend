# Docker Compose — Local Development Database
# =============================================================================
#
# Spins up a single PostgreSQL 17 container for local development.
# Run with:  docker compose up -d
# Stop with: docker compose down          (keeps data)
#            docker compose down -v        (deletes data volume too)
#
# The ${VAR:-default} syntax reads from your .env file at project root.
# If the variable is missing, the value after :- is used as a fallback.
#
# The "healthcheck" block makes Docker repeatedly ask Postgres "are you
# ready?" — other services (or scripts) that depend on this container
# can wait until the health check passes before connecting.
#
# The named volume "pgdata" stores database files outside the container,
# so your data survives container restarts and rebuilds.
